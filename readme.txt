VIC-20 GS
=========

This is an early attempt to learn kicad and also to learn how to create an IC library.
This design is for a VIC-20 "Game System" as imagined by me. It does not
include cassette interface or power components onboard. I have added extra features.

This design has not been verified, breadboarded or routed so use at own risk. It is
released as-is and may contain errors.
